Absolutely 👍 — here’s a **step-by-step guide with all the code and commands** you need to **run your Streamlit Drowsiness Detection app in VS Code** from start to finish.

## 🧠 Step-by-Step: Run Streamlit App in VS Code

### 🪜 Step 1: Open VS Code

1. Launch **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Click **File → Open Folder** and select your project folder
   (for example: `C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\Python Dashboard Project`).

---

### 🧱 Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

In the VS Code **Terminal** (`` Ctrl + ` ``):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Then activate it:

* **Windows**

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
* **Mac/Linux**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

You should now see `(venv)` appear before your terminal prompt.

---

### 🧩 Step 3: Install Required Libraries

Run this command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install streamlit opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

Optional (only for Windows sound alert):

```bash
pip install winsound
```

> ⚠️ `winsound` comes preinstalled on Windows; skip this if you get “No matching distribution found”.

---

### 📄 Step 4: Create Your Python File

Create a file named **`app.py`** in your VS Code project folder and paste your full code (the drowsiness detection code you shared earlier).

Example:

```
📁 Drowsiness-Detection/
│
├── app.py
└── requirements.txt   (optional)
```

---

### 🧠 Step 5: (Optional) Create `requirements.txt`

In the same folder, create a file called `requirements.txt` and paste:

```
streamlit
opencv-python
mediapipe
numpy
```

---

### ▶️ Step 6: Run the App

In the terminal (make sure your virtual environment is active):

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

### 🌐 Step 7: Open in Browser

After running, you’ll see something like:

```
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

Local URL: http://localhost:8501
```

Click that link or copy it into your browser — your **Drowsiness Detection Dashboard** will appear.

🧰 Common Troubleshooting

| Problem                     | Fix                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `No module named streamlit` | Run `pip install streamlit` again in the **same environment** |
| Webcam not opening          | Close any other app using the webcam, or check permissions    |
| “TensorFlow warnings”       | Already handled with your `os` and `logging` settings         |

---

✅ **You’re done!**
Your Drowsiness Detection app should now run live inside your browser — and you can edit the code directly in VS Code for instant updates.
